## Atlassian MCP (Confluence Search)

The project includes a `.mcp.json` that configures the [Atlassian MCP server](https://mcp.atlassian.com) for Claude Code. This enables Claude to search Confluence directly using natural language rather than raw API calls.

### First-time setup

1. Open Claude Code in this project directory
2. Run `/mcp` inside Claude Code
3. Select **atlassian** and choose **Authenticate**
4. Complete the OAuth login in your browser — you'll be redirected back automatically

### Verify it's connected

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Once authenticated, Claude can search Confluence natively during health check analysis (e.g. looking up KBAs for FAIL results).
